# odin-recipes
This project is part of The Odin Project, aimed at building foundational HTML skills by creating a simple recipe website.

# Overview
The website showcases a collection of recipes, structured as follows:

A main page (index.html) serves as the homepage.
- Each recipe is displayed on its own dedicated page.
- Every recipe page includes an image of the dish along with its details.
- The main page contains links to all recipe pages in an ordered list, making it easy to navigate between recipes.

# Development Process
This project followed a structured development process:

1. Built the basic HTML boilerplate and homepage with a heading ("Odin Recipes").
2. Created individual recipe pages for each dish.
3. Updated the homepage with a list of recipes, linking each one to its respective page.

# Version Control
Multiple commits were made at key stages of development to document progress.
The project has been pushed to GitHub for version tracking and collaboration.

# How to Use
Clone or download the repository.
Open index.html in any web browser to view the homepage and navigate to the recipes.
